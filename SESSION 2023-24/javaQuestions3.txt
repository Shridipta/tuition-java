PROGRAM 247 : TO DISPLAY ALL THE LUCKY NUMBERS UPTO A NATURAL NUMBER N
		EG. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
		    1, 3, 5, 7, 9
		    1, 3, 7

PROGRAM 248 : TO ACCEPT A NUMBER AND CHECK IF IT IS FASCINATING NUMBER OR NOT
		
PROGRAM 249 : TO PRINT ALL THE SET OF TRIAD NUMBERS (FANCY NUMBERS)

PROGRAM 250 : TO ACCEPT A NUMBER AND CHECK IF ITS CYCLIC NUMBER OR NOT (WITH ARRAY AND WITHOUT ARRAY)
		EG. 142857*1 = 142857
		    142857*2 = 285714

PROGRAM 251 : TO CHECK WHETHER A NUMBER IS SMITH NUMBER OR NOT
	      A NUMBER IS SAID TO BE SMITH NUMBER IF THE SUM OF THE DIGITS OF THE NUMBER IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE PRIME FACTORS OF THAT NUMBER
		EG. 666 
		    6+6+6 = 18
		    PRIME FACTORS = 2+3+3+7 = 18

PROGRAM 252 : TO FIND MOBIUS FUNCTION OF NATURAL NUMBER n WHICH IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
	      M(n) = 0 IF n = 1
	      M(n) = 1 IF PRIME FACTORS ARE REPEATED
	      M(n) = (-1)^p IF THERE ARE p DISTINCT PRIME FACTORS OF n
		EG. M(34) = 1	
		    M(78) = -1
		    M(12) = 1

PROGRAM 253 : (KAPREKAR CONSTANT) TO ACCEPT A 4 DIGIT NUMBER AND DISPLAY ALL THE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS TILL THE GENERATION OF KAPREKAR CONSTANT 6174
	      EXCEPT ALL DIGITS IN THE NUMBER ARE EQUAL
		
	      STEPS: MAKE THE INTERMEDIATE DIFFERENCE A DESCENDING NUMBER AND SUBTRACT THE REVERSE OF THE INTERMEDIATE DESCENDING DIFFERENCE FROM IT
	      INPUT: 1234
		    DISPLAY
		     4321	4321-1234 = 3087
		     8730	8730-0378 = 8352
		     8532	8532-2358 = 6174
		     6174 	
		     
PROGRAM 254 : TO ACCEPT DATA INTO R*C ORDER MATRIX AND DISPLAY THE DATA IN MATRIX FORMAT
PROGRAM 255 : TO CREATE A 2D ARRAY OF SIZE 3,4 WITH FIRST TWELVE NATURAL NUMBERS COLUMNWISE AND DISPLAY IT IN MATRIX FORMAT

		  2  5  8  11
		  3  6  9  12 
PROGRAM 256 : TO ACCEPT DATA INTO A M*N MATRIX AND DISPLAY THE SUM OF EACH ROW AND SUM OF EACH COLUMN
PROGRAM 257 : TO FIND THE TRANSPOSE OF A M*N ORDER MATRIX
	      EG. INPUT => 2 5 7
			   4 3 1
		  OUTPUT => 2 4
			    5 3
			    7 1
PROGRAM 258 : TO FIND THE SUM OF THE LEFT DIAGONAL AND RIGHT DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF A SQUARE MATRIX SEPARATELY
PROGRAM 259 : TO CHECK WHETHER A MATRIX IS SYMMETRICAL OR NOT
	      A SYMMETRIC MATRIX IS A SQUARE MATRIX FOR WHICH arr[i][j] = arr[j][i]
